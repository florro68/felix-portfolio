  <h1>Felix I. Flores – Photography Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Hello and welcome to my site. I am Felix, a photographer, observer, and storyteller. My work has changed. I no longer just take photos. I create them with purpose, patience, and presence. I have grown in technique, but more importantly, I have learned to see. To slow down. To frame not just what is there, but what it means. Each image now reflects more than a moment. It reflects intent. Stillness. Story. This portfolio marks that shift. It is not just about what I saw. It is about how I chose to show it. This is where my craft became a voice.</p>
